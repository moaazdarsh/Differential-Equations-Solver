# DE Solver
After studying differential equations and the C++ programming language during my third semester, I decided to immediately apply this knowledge in the winter break by making a numerical DEs solver.

The DEs course only had a brief part about numerical analysis but it was helpful in this project, I started this project with 1st order DEs and the heat equation since these are the subjects I was exposed to during the course.
